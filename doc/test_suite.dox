/*! \page test_framework Run the testing framework

<div class="alert alert-danger">
  This part needs to be revised (and the capability needs to be
  introduced again)!
</div>

The testing framework is based on the [Test Anyting Protocol]
(http://testanything.org/). The tests are stored in the eponymous
folder. In order to run them type in:

    make check

The tests can be run on multiple cores with the additional flag -j.
Testing in parallel executation is however not implemented yet.
