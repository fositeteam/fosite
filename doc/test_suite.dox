/*! \page test_framework Run the testing framework

The testing framework is based on the testing environment of cmake ([CTest] 
(https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/module/CTest.html)). The tests are stored in the eponymous
folder. In order to run them type

    make test

from the build folder. The tests can be run on multiple cores with the additional flag -j.
Testing in parallel executation is however not implemented yet.
